I paired programed with Andrew Hansel

we made a struct and an array to hold all of our struct values.
Then in Main we check if there is a file passed in, if not we print out the error code.
malloc a buffer to store our results
find out how many files are going through the program
for the first for loop we iterate through the number of files and then each time we pass it in and run the inner for loop
mmap to store in the heap and we compare the temp char to the character we currently hold.
uses the function createResult to add total count and current character.
then we write from heap to stdout
